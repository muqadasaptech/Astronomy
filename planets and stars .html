                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, has been a major
                    focus of recent astronomical research. With groundbreaking missions like NASA's Juno spacecraft,
                    launched in 2011, scientists are uncovering unprecedented details about its composition, weather
                    patterns, and magnetic field. Juno, which entered Jupiter's orbit in 2016, is revealing the planet's
                    internal structure, including the extent of its deep atmosphere, and how its massive magnetic field
                    is generated. These insights are crucial not only for understanding Jupiter itself, but also for
                    advancing our knowledge of planetary formation and the dynamics of other planetary systems in the
                    universe. In particular, Juno’s close-up observations are providing new data on Jupiter’s Great Red
                    Spot, a centuries-old storm that continues to defy full explanation, and its role in Jupiter’s
                    atmospheric dynamics.</p>

                    Deep Dive</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">Jupiter’s composition is a subject of intense study,
                    especially in light of new data from missions like Juno and the Hubble Space Telescope. Jupiter is
                    primarily made up of hydrogen and helium—elements that constitute the majority of the gas giants.
                    But it's the distribution of these elements that continues to intrigue scientists. Recent
                    measurements have suggested that Jupiter's core may be much larger and more complex than previously
                    thought. Some studies propose that it could have a "core" surrounded by a layer of metallic
                    hydrogen, with deep layers extending far below the planet's visible clouds.

                    In addition to this, scientists are using the data from Juno’s gravity measurements to gain a better
                    understanding of how Jupiter’s atmosphere interacts with its interior, providing a more complete
                    picture of how massive planets like Jupiter form and evolve. These findings help us understand the
                    building blocks of planetary systems and offer a window into how other, more distant exoplanets,
                    could be structured. The similarities between Jupiter’s structure and that of other gas giants like
                    Saturn and Uranus also reveal important clues about the diversity of planetary systems that exist in
                    our galaxy.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 2.5rem;">Jupiter vs. Stars: A Comparative Analysis
                </h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">While Jupiter is not a star, it has often been referred
                    to as a “failed star” due to its composition and internal heat. The debate about whether Jupiter
                    could have ever ignited into a star is ongoing, as its core temperature and pressure are high enough
                    to support nuclear fusion, but not on a large enough scale to sustain it. In fact, Jupiter emits
                    more heat than it receives from the Sun, suggesting that there are still ongoing processes deep
                    inside the planet. This makes Jupiter more similar to brown dwarfs—objects that are too large to be
                    planets but not quite large enough to sustain the fusion processes that power stars.

                    Astronomers are now examining the similarities between Jupiter and other objects in the universe
                    that are on the borderline between planets and stars. These include "hot Jupiters," which are gas
                    giants found orbiting close to their parent stars, and brown dwarfs, which may share similar
                    atmospheric features to Jupiter. These objects are providing insight into the role that gas giants
                    play in stellar formation and evolution, especially when studying the different ways they form and
                    how their atmospheres evolve over time. Understanding how Jupiter compares to stars not only helps
                    us study our own solar system but also improves our knowledge of star formation in other parts of
                    the galaxy.</p>

                    Window into Habitability</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">Jupiter’s moons, particularly Europa, Ganymede, and
                    Callisto, are among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system, with the potential to host life.
                    Europa, one of Jupiter’s largest moons, has been the subject of intense study because of the
                    subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust. Scientists believe that Europa's ocean may be in contact
                    with a rocky mantle, providing the necessary conditions for life to exist. In recent years, studies
                    have shown evidence of potential plumes of water vapor erupting from Europa’s surface, which could
                    give us direct access to samples of its ocean without having to drill through miles of ice.

                    The exploration of these moons is set to intensify with missions like NASA's Europa Clipper, set to
                    launch in the 2020s, which will conduct detailed reconnaissance of Europa's ice shell and subsurface
                    ocean. Ganymede, which has its own magnetic field, and Callisto, which is thought to have a more
                    stable, icy surface, may also provide vital clues about the potential for life elsewhere in the
                    universe. As we learn more about these moons, we are gaining critical insights into the habitability
                    of icy moons around gas giants—an area of astrobiological research that could change the way we
                    think about life beyond Earth.</p>

                    of Planets and Stars</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">The next decade promises to bring exciting new missions
                    that will expand our knowledge of Jupiter and its place in the broader context of the universe. The
                    James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), slated to launch in the near future, will provide unprecedented
                    infrared observations of Jupiter’s atmosphere, allowing scientists to study its cloud formations,
                    storm systems, and potentially even discover new moons.

                    In addition to the JWST, the upcoming Europa Clipper mission will give us a closer look at the icy
                    moon, Europa, and its potential for habitability. The detailed data from Europa Clipper will help
                    scientists understand how subsurface oceans on icy moons could harbor microbial life. As space
                    exploration technology improves, these missions are set to revolutionize our understanding of not
                    only Jupiter but of how planets and moons in other solar systems may support life. New discoveries
                    may also be made about exoplanets—planets that exist outside our solar system—and their similarities
                    to Jupiter, providing more context for the formation and evolution of planets and stars across the
                    galaxy.</p>

                    Diversity</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">Planets form from the dust and gas surrounding
                    newly-formed stars. This protoplanetary disk of gas and dust collides and coalesces to form solid
                    bodies that eventually become planets. While most planets are found orbiting stars like our Sun,
                    astronomers have discovered many exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system, including those in
                    star systems very different from our own. These include gas giants like Jupiter, rocky planets like
                    Earth, and even planets orbiting binary star systems, offering a glimpse of the vast diversity of
                    planetary systems across the galaxy. The study of planetary systems is vital for understanding the
                    conditions that might support life and the processes that drive planetary formation and evolution.

                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">Moons, the natural satellites that orbit planets, are an
                    exciting area of exploration. While Earth's Moon is familiar, scientists are increasingly focused on
                    moons of other planets, particularly in the outer solar system. Moons like Europa (Jupiter),
                    Enceladus (Saturn), and Titan (Saturn) are intriguing because they harbor subsurface oceans, which
                    could potentially support life. Recent missions like NASA's Europa Clipper, slated to launch in the
                    coming years, are designed to investigate the habitability of such moons. The study of these moons
                    could revolutionize our understanding of life beyond Earth and provide crucial insights into the
                    conditions that make moons potential "hotspots" for extraterrestrial biology.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">Rings are found around the gas giants in our solar
                    system—Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Saturn’s iconic rings, made of ice and rock particles,
                    are the most well-known. Jupiter’s faint rings, however, are less visible and composed primarily of
                    dust particles from its moons. The study of these planetary rings helps scientists understand the
                    dynamics of planetary environments and the processes that lead to the formation and evolution of
                    ring systems. New findings from missions like NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which explored Saturn and
                    its rings in detail, continue to expand our knowledge of how these structures form and change over
                    time.</p>

                    Solar System</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">The distance of a planet from its star plays a crucial
                    role in determining its characteristics, including temperature, atmosphere, and potential for
                    supporting life. In our solar system, the planets are located at varying distances from the Sun. For
                    example, Mercury is closest to the Sun, with an average distance of about 57 million kilometers,
                    while Neptune, the most distant planet, orbits at around 4.5 billion kilometers. As we explore
                    exoplanets in other star systems, astronomers are learning that distance from the star, along with
                    other factors like the planet’s size, composition, and atmospheric conditions, are key in
                    determining whether a planet might support life.</p>

                    History</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">The formation of planets and stars share common origins
                    in a molecular cloud—a dense region of gas and dust in space. These clouds collapse under their own
                    gravity, forming stars in the process. Planets then form in the surrounding disk of gas and dust
                    that remains. This is known as the nebular hypothesis. New observations from the Hubble Space
                    Telescope and ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) have revealed the processes of
                    star and planet formation in real-time, allowing scientists to study the early stages of planet
                    creation around young stars. Understanding these processes is key to understanding the origin of our
                    own solar system and the conditions necessary for life.</p>

                    Dynamics</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">The atmospheres of planets play a vital role in shaping
                    their climates, weather patterns, and habitability. For example, Earth's atmosphere, composed
                    primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, supports life. In contrast, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps
                    heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in the solar system. On Jupiter,
                    the atmosphere is made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with ammonia, methane, and water vapor
                    contributing to its dynamic weather systems. Jupiter’s famous Great Red Spot, a massive storm that
                    has been raging for centuries, is one example of the dramatic atmospheric processes at work on gas
                    giants. Understanding these planetary atmospheres is essential for determining whether conditions
                    for life could exist on other worlds, especially exoplanets in distant star systems.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">Stars are born from the collapse of gas and dust in
                    molecular clouds, with gravity causing the material to heat up and form a protostar. Once the core
                    temperature is high enough, nuclear fusion begins, and the star starts to shine. Stars live for
                    millions to billions of years, depending on their size, and their ultimate fate depends on their
                    mass. Low-mass stars like our Sun expand into red giants before shedding their outer layers and
                    becoming white dwarfs. High-mass stars, on the other hand, explode as supernovae, leaving behind
                    neutron stars or black holes. The study of stellar evolution is crucial for understanding the
                    formation of elements, the dynamics of galaxies, and the conditions for life in the universe.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">The next generation of space missions will provide
                    deeper insights into planets, moons, and stars across our galaxy. Missions like the James Webb Space
                    Telescope (JWST), set to launch soon, will provide high-resolution infrared images of distant
                    exoplanets and their atmospheres. The study of these distant worlds will help us understand how
                    planets form and evolve around other stars. On the other hand, upcoming missions to the outer
                    planets and their moons, such as Europa Clipper and Dragonfly (which will explore Titan), will give
                    us a closer look at the potential for life in our own solar system. With new technologies and
                    advanced telescopes, humanity is on the verge of discovering answers to some of the most profound
                    questions about the origins and future of planets, stars, and life itself.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 2.5rem;">Surface</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">Jupiter is a gas giant, meaning it doesn't have a solid
                    surface like Earth. Instead, its upper atmosphere is composed of thick clouds made of hydrogen,
                    helium, ammonia, and methane. As you descend deeper into the planet, the atmospheric pressure
                    increases dramatically, and the gases transition into a supercritical state—where they exhibit
                    properties of both liquids and gases.

                    The planet's "surface" is essentially the top of its thick, gaseous atmosphere, which is constantly
                    swirling with powerful storms and high-speed winds. These winds create the distinctive bands of
                    color that stretch across Jupiter's atmosphere. These bands, called "zones" and "belts," result from
                    variations in temperature and chemical composition. The famous Great Red Spot is a massive,
                    centuries-old storm that rages in the southern hemisphere, and it is one of the most well-known
                    features of Jupiter’s upper atmosphere.

                    Beneath these clouds, the atmospheric pressure becomes so intense that hydrogen is compressed into
                    liquid form. This transition, along with extreme temperatures, contributes to the planet's
                    mysterious and volatile atmospheric behavior. Despite the lack of a solid surface, Jupiter's
                    atmosphere is highly dynamic, with storms, lightning, and a complex system of winds and cloud
                    formations that scientists are still trying to fully understand.</p>

            <!-- Structure Section -->
            <div class="mb-5">
                <h2 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 2.5rem;">Structure</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">Jupiter's internal structure is made up of several
                    distinct layers, each with unique characteristics. The outermost layer is the thick, gaseous
                    atmosphere composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, which we observe from telescopes and space
                    missions. As you descend deeper into the planet, the pressure increases rapidly, causing the
                    hydrogen gas to compress into a liquid state. This transition from gas to liquid occurs around 1,000
                    kilometers below the cloud tops, and is one of the most fascinating features of Jupiter's structure.

                    Below the liquid hydrogen layer, scientists believe there exists a layer of metallic hydrogen. In
                    this layer, hydrogen behaves like a metal under extreme pressure, conducting electricity and
                    contributing to the planet’s powerful magnetic field. The strength of Jupiter’s magnetic field is
                    about 14 times stronger than Earth's, and it is generated by the motion of metallic hydrogen within
                    the planet’s interior.

                    At the very core of Jupiter lies a dense, rocky or possibly icy core. Although this core has never
                    been directly observed due to the extreme pressures and depths, scientists believe it is about the
                    size of Earth and contains heavy elements such as iron and nickel. This core likely accounts for a
                    significant portion of the planet’s mass, but it is surrounded by several layers of hydrogen and
                    helium. Some recent data from NASA's Juno mission suggests that the core may be larger and more
                    diffuse than previously thought, leading to ongoing debates about Jupiter's internal structure.

                    Understanding Jupiter’s structure is crucial not only for understanding the planet itself but also
                    for gaining insights into the formation of gas giants in general. The details of how Jupiter’s
                    layers interact, the role of metallic hydrogen, and the behavior of its core help scientists model
                    the evolution of other gas giants, including exoplanets discovered in distant star systems.</p>
